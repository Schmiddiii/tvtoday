A application to inspect the television program of today. Made for the pinephone.

This application is still in development, but should work.

This application currently only supports [TV SPIELFILM](https://www.tvspielfilm.de/), but can be extended to work on any website serving similar content.

# What it can do

- Show the channel and movie title in a list. If available, the channel icon will be shown instead of the name.
- Getting more information about the movie by clicking on the movie in the list. This includes the year, a description, etc.
- Swiping to go back.

# What it cannot do (yet)

- Filter out unwanted channels, genres, etc.

# What it will never be able to do

- Watch the movies.
